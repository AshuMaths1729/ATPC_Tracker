I was missing many placement opportunities because I opened the 
placement portal occasionally, like once in 2 weeks.
So, I thought to make an application that will be right there on
my desktop and I will be able to see what opportunities are available
for which I can apply.
The application shows the company name and the link to apply for the 
same.
The user can go to the link by double clicking and copying the link
into the browser.
